&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;The problem&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Screens tend to have a lot of pixels these days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="screens" src="https://nical.github.io/images/rustfest/screen.svg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To the point that when rendering interesting vector graphics (or rendering anything, really) at a high resolution, the per-pixel work adds up and becomes a real challenge for the CPU to process sequentially. Our goal here is to render complex vector graphics at interactive frame rates (This typically means a 16ms budget per frame) and we'd obviously like to have some processing power left to do other things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Filling paths on the CPU&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am going to use the term "rasterization" and "rasterizer" quite a bit in this post. &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rasterisation"&gt;Rasterization&lt;/a&gt;, in a nutshell, is the action of turning vector graphics into raster graphics. In other words it's taking vector graphics and rendering them into pixels. I'll focus on filling paths which is probably the most common primitive, but it's not the only thing vector graphics are made of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What's the deal with GPUs, anyway? I have a beefy CPU, isn't that enough?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because images are usually laid out in memory row by row in a contiguous buffer, it's ideal to fill shapes from top to bottom, row after row to maximize cache locality of memory accesses and help the CPU's prefetcher.
So it comes without surprise that most path filling implementations use &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweep_line_algorithm"&gt;sweep-line algorithms&lt;/a&gt;. The general idea is to start with a list of the path's edges sorted from top to bottom. Imagine an imaginary line (the sweep-line) that traverses the output image a row of pixels at a time. We maintain another list, this one containing the edges that intersect the current row, sorted from left to right (let's call them active edges). During the traversal we use the first sorted list to know which edges to add to the active edge list and when. For each row we go through the active edge list to figure out where to start and stop filling pixels, as well as what to do with pixels that are partially covered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="sweep line" src="https://nical.github.io/images/rustfest/sweepline.gif"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are variations around this algorithm. For example some implementations run the algorithm in a single pass while others will first generate a data structure that represents the spans of pixels to fill and then fill the pixels in a second pass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sweep-lines are very useful when dealing with a lot of different geometry problems (2D and 3D alike) I think that I'll come back to what I like so much about them in another post (maybe in part 3).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now if you are interested in knowing more about this stuff I recommend having a look at &lt;a href="https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/3737701cfab93ccea04c0e9cab211ad10f931d87/gfx/skia/skia/src/core/SkScan_Path.cpp#106"&gt;Skia's scanline rasterization code&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/freetype/freetype2.git/tree/src/raster/ftraster.c?id=af585ad4fec965fa85f5d61c759f3bc940936de4#n2652"&gt;Freetype's&lt;/a&gt;. The coding style is different but the overall principle is the same. Oh and since this blog post is written in the context of rustfest, you can check &lt;a href="https://github.com/redox-os/rusttype/blob/master/src/rasterizer.rs"&gt;rusttype's rasterizer&lt;/a&gt; out too, it's implemented in rust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="scanline fill" src="https://nical.github.io/images/rustfest/raster.svg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is another approach worth mentioning implemented in &lt;a href="https://medium.com/@raphlinus/inside-the-fastest-font-renderer-in-the-world-75ae5270c445"&gt;font.rs&lt;/a&gt;, which involves rendering information about the outline of the shape in an accumulation buffer and using that as input to fill the shape in a single tightly optimized loop over the destination image. Notable about this approach is the simplicity of the main filling loop. It runs the same logic on all pixels inside and outside of the shape with very few branches which is very efficient on modern CPUs, at the expense of going over pixels that are outside the shape. When rendering very small images this trade-off works wonderfully. When rendering at very large resolutions, having a sparse representation to avoid touching pixels outside of the shape begins paying off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a good segue into an important point: There is no optimal one-size-fits-all (or should I say, one-fits-all-sizes!) solution.
When filling a small amount of pixels, a lot of time is typically spent computing the anti-aliasing along the edges, while paths that cover lots of pixel tend to put more pressure on memory bandwidth filling the interior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With lyon I focused on large paths covering many pixels, and I wouldn't advise using lyon to render very small text. In another post in this series I will talk a bit about &lt;a href="https://github.com/pcwalton/pathfinder"&gt;pathfinder&lt;/a&gt; which implements two algorithms: one for small resolutions (typically text), and one for larger paths.
I think that there is no way around having dedicated implementations if you want to cover both use cases optimally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Overdraw&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We saw how to figure out which pixels are inside a shape and fill them. From there to a drawing containing hundreds of paths the process is usually to render these paths individually from back to front, so that front-most elements don't get overwritten by the ones behind them.
Simple enough, however this means that for drawings that are built upon many shapes stacked on top of one another like the famous GhostScript tiger, pixels will typically get written to many times. It's quite a shame, because it means that hidden parts add to the rendering cost just as much as the rest even though they do not contribute to the final image.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="ghostscript tiger overdraw" src="https://nical.github.io/images/rustfest/tiger-overdraw.svg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The image above gives an idea of the overdraw for the GhostScript tiger. The lighter a pixel is, the more times it is written to with a traditional back to front rendering algorithm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where overdraw really hurts is usually memory bandwidth. Unfortunately hammering memory tends to make every thing else slower as well. The other threads end up sitting around waiting for memory which limits parallelism, and after the algorithm is done running, other code will typically run into cold caches. It is very hard to avoid this cost in the context of rasterizing 2D graphics on the CPU (in the best case scenario we have to touch every pixel at least once which is already quite a lot).
I have to mention a very cool technique that helps a lot here: the "full-scene rasterizer" approach which consists in having a single sweep-line that renders all paths at once and therefore can touch pixels only once. The rumor has it that the Flash runtime has such an implementation. See also &lt;a href="https://github.com/jrmuizel/full-scene-rasterizer/"&gt;Jeff Muizelaar's full-scene rasterizer&lt;/a&gt; which is open-source. This is however quite hard to implement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;What about games?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how do games manage to render so much complex content at interactive frame rates?
For a large part the answer is that games almost always use the GPU for graphics tasks. GPU's have been historically designed and optimized specifically for the needs of the games industry. It would be great if we could leverage these hardware level optimizations when working with 2D content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now saying that something's going to be fast because it uses the GPU is certainly not enough. It is very easy to do slow things with a GPU, especially when trying to port CPU code over. Rather than try to adapt a CPU algorithm to the GPU let's try to reformulate our 2D rendering problem in a way that corresponds to the type of inputs GPUs typically get.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="3D rendering" src="https://nical.github.io/images/rustfest/3d.svg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The vast majority of 3D content in interactive applications is made of triangle meshes. The GPU has dedicated hardware for dealing with triangles which makes this primitive very appealing for us. Perhaps if we turn vector shapes into flat triangle meshes (conceptually like a 3D mesh with z = 0) we can get somewhere, and that's the direction I took with lyon.
There are other approaches to rendering vector graphics on the GPU. As I mentioned earlier I don't believe in a one-size-fits-all solution, however I am pretty confident about geometry-based approaches (leveraging the triangle rasterizer) for the use cases I care most about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another interesting feature of the GPU's rasterization pipeline is the depth buffer which contains the depth of each pixel in screen-space. This allows games to render opaque objects in any order and reject pixels that are further behind if something closer to the viewer has already been rendered at that location.
This is a convenient trick for correctness but it is also a great tool to reduce memory bandwidth, since by rendering opaque objects front to back, one can minimize the amount of time pixels are written to and greatly reduce memory bandwidth (remember that memory bandwidth was a big issue for CPU rasterization). Transparent objects are then rendered back to front since painting order actually matters for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="z-buffer" src="https://nical.github.io/images/rustfest/zbuffer.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The illustration above was not in the rustfest presentation but perhaps it will help understanding what I am getting at with the depth buffer savings. This is a trick we use in WebRender that consists in rendering opaque shapes in front to back order with the depth buffer enabled to avoid touching pixels many times.
The memory bandwidth savings are actually greater than they seem thanks to smart optimizations implemented in the hardware that allow it to quickly discard entire blocks of pixels at a time before computing their color and writing them to memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Rendering 2D graphics like a 3D game&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lyon in it's current state is not a 2D rendering engine. It is mainly a way to take vector graphics primitives such as paths, and turn them into triangle meshes in a format that is straightforward to render on the GPU (but lyon doesn't implement the GPU bits at this point). The process of turning paths into triangle meshes is called &lt;em&gt;tessellation&lt;/em&gt; (some also use the word &lt;em&gt;triangulation&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Lyon logo as a triangle mesh" src="https://nical.github.io/images/lyon-logo-tessellated.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there is a beautiful thing about leveraging the GPU's triangle rasterization pipeline, is that since rendering becomes similar to a video game, we can use the graphics hardware exactly the way it has been meant to be used and benefit from many years of rendering tricks and optimizations from the games industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The front to back depth buffer trick I mentioned earlier is not actually something implemented in lyon. It is just a very common optimization in 3D game engines which applies naturally when rendering paths tessellated using lyon. It is also a technique we use in &lt;a href="https://github.com/servo/webrender"&gt;webrender&lt;/a&gt; to great effects, and (spoiler alert) it's also &lt;a href="https://github.com/pcwalton/pathfinder"&gt;pathfinder&lt;/a&gt;'s most significant optimization for large paths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is only one of the many tricks that we can learn from games. Game developers have come up with interesting approaches to anti-aliasing, various graphics effects, animation, handling thousands of individual objects and many more challenges which we can apply to our own needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;À suivre...&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was part two. We had a superficial look at 2D rendering on the CPU and I argued that there are some benefits to picking a games-like approach to rendering on the GPU.
In the next post we will delve into lyon's tessellation algorithm itself.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>RustFest Paris - Part 1 - Intro</title><link href="https://nical.github.io/posts/rustfest-paris-01.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-06-18T00:00:00+02:00</published><updated>2018-06-18T00:00:00+02:00</updated><author><name>Nical</name></author><id>tag:nical.github.io,2018-06-18:/posts/rustfest-paris-01.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="lets talk about vector graphics svg" src="https://nical.github.io/images/rustfest/intro.svg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though I didn't feel super good about the flow of my speech this time around, I think that the talk was well received and the last minute "let's fix my window manager" episode didn't turn into a disaster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It motivated me to write a series of short blog posts about the content of the talk, and explain in more details the information which I was delivering in a hurry in the hope that I wouldn't blow up the talk's allocated time slice. Most of the images in this series of posts are slides from the presentation (made in SVG with Inkscape), but there will be additional content too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="rustfest-paris-01.html"&gt;Part 1 - Intro&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="rustfest-paris-02.html"&gt;Part 2 - Path rendering challenges&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Part 3 - Lyon's path tessellation algorithm&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Part 4 - Other GPU rendering approaches.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post is the introduction of the talk, wherein I introduce vector graphics and try to get the audience somewhat excited about it. Things will get technical in the follow-up posts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;RustFest&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before I delve into the talk, I'd like to thank the organizers for their great work on RustFest. I can only begin to imagine how stressful and exhausting it can be to organize such an event and I believe it paid off. I had a great time and I believe the other attendees did as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Raster graphics and vector graphics&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before I delve into lyon, let's get the terminology straight. Raster graphics is what typically comes to mind when thinking about images: a uniform grid of pixels where the color of each pixel is specified independently. Working with uniform grids has a lot of nice properties, for example having random-access in the content of the image to sample the color at a particular point, and being able to perform complex operations that sort of rely on random access like convolution filters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand raster images force authors to think about the resolution at which content is produced versus resolution at which it is presented (the output resolution of a screen for example), and they don't always happen to line up perfectly. So what happens when a 800x450 pixels image has to fill a 2560x1440 pixels screen? In most cases the image will look either blurrier or pixelated. At high resolutions, raster images occupy a lot of space. Image compression formats (png, jpeg and more modern successors) do their best to mitigate that in clever ways but size remains a limiting factor when dealing with large amounts of high resolution raster images, be it in terms of disk pass, or network bandwidth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="slide raster vs vector" src="https://nical.github.io/images/rustfest/rstr-vctr.svg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, specifying 2D content pixel by pixel is not the only choice we have at our disposal. In a lot of cases we can author and distribute not the resulting image but the steps to produce it. In very broad terms this is what I refer to when talking about vector graphics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think of the SVG format which can be produced with Inkscape or illustrator. With vector graphics instead of specifying a grid of pixel colors you deal in terms of squares, circles, shapes, polygons, bézier curves, which you can fill and stroke with different types of patterns such as solid colors and gradients. Of course these shapes will eventually get rasterized into a raster image since that's what your screen understands, but the description of vector graphics allows to a great extent to be resolution-independent and happens to be very compact (since specifying a red square requires a small amount of data no matter how many pixels this square will eventually cover).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond SVG, I consider HTML/CSS to be a vector graphics format, since it is built around the idea of describing how to display 2D content rather than specifying each pixel individually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The little shape in the image above doesn't look like much but add many more and you can end up with complex drawings like the famous GhostScript tiger which inevitably appears in any presentation on the topic of vector graphics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="tiger" src="https://nical.github.io/images/rustfest/tiger.svg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Vector graphics everywhere&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today graphical applications all make use of vector graphics. Fonts are almost always described with vector formats, user interfaces, just like web pages need to be described in a way that adapts to various layouts and resolutions, a problem that vector graphics lends itself to addressing naturally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="ui slide" src="https://nical.github.io/images/rustfest/ui.svg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using a vector format to describe maps avoids spending a lot of network bandwidth on all of these pixels and lets you zoom in and out of a map without seeing a blurry mess (unless the application is unable to render the map at interactive frame rate and choses to show you a scaled version of the previous frame while it renders the new one).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="maps" src="https://nical.github.io/images/rustfest/map.svg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using vector graphics in games can be useful as well. Today, 3D and 2D games come with gigabytes of assets, a huge part of it being fairly high resolution textures. This can be very inconvenient when attempting to distribute games over the network or even just fitting the game alongside the other installed apps in a relatively small drive.
Some games could also take advantage of the resolution-independence to present content at different scales for gameplay purposes or to enhance the story telling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="rpg" src="https://nical.github.io/images/rustfest/rpg.svg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Vector graphics at 60 frames per seconds&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turns out that rendering a screen-full of complex vector graphics at an interactive frame rate is challenging. Whether it is on a laptop or a phone, Screens tend to have a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of pixels. Filling this many pixels with interesting content means a fair amount of arithmetic, and involves a lot of memory accesses. To make things worse, the drawing model for 2D content is typically based on the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Painter%27s_algorithm"&gt;painter's algorithm&lt;/a&gt; which consists in drawing back to front, and this content is usually built upon many overlapping layers. Take a closer look at the tiger above to see what I mean. pixels tend to be written to many times (this is called overdraw), which amplifies the cost of rendering at a high resolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="screens" src="https://nical.github.io/images/rustfest/screen.svg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result of that a lot of applications tend to consider rendering complex vector graphics to be too expensive for high frequency updates and either bake 2D content into textures before releasing the product (a lot of games do that) or architect their rendering tech around hiding this cost, for example by rendering to intermediate surfaces at a low frequency while these surfaces are composited to the screen at a higher frequency, which allows some types of animations stay at a solid 60fps (web browsers in particular do this).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;À suivre...&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's it for part one. In the next post we'll look at how games approach the problem of redrawing the entire screen with complex content at interactive frame rates. We'll see that we can take advantage of these solutions and apply them to rendering 2D vector graphics as well.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Introduction to lyon: 2D vector graphics rendering on the GPU in rust</title><link href="https://nical.github.io/posts/lyon-intro.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-01-22T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2018-01-22T00:00:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Nical</name></author><id>tag:nical.github.io,2018-01-22:/posts/lyon-intro.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://crates.io/crates/lyon"&gt;&lt;img alt="crate" src="https://meritbadge.herokuapp.com/lyon"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Tessellation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Path tessellation (or triangulation), in a nutshell, is taking a path (for example a &lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Path2D/Path2D"&gt;canvas&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/paths.html#PathData"&gt;SVG&lt;/a&gt; path) and approximating it with a set of triangles (like the way we usually represent 3d models but in 2d). While the output of the tessellator is customizable, lyon is pretty much designed for generating vertex and index buffers, which anyone working with low level graphics APIs should be familiar with. As a result we obtain geometry in a format that is very easy to work with on the GPU using the same techniques used for 3D graphics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="tessellated shape" src="https://nical.github.io/images/lyon-logo-tessellated.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Monotone decomposition&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how do we go about tessellating a path? The three most common algorithms are &lt;a href="https://www.geometrictools.com/Documentation/TriangulationByEarClipping.pdf"&gt;ear-clipping&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/m.slater/Teaching/CG/1997-98/Solutions/Trap/"&gt;trapezoidal decomposition&lt;/a&gt; and monotone decomposition. In lyon I went for the latter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traditionally this algorithm is performed in three passes over the geometry:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The first step is to partition the shape in non-self-intersecting shapes (usually using the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bentley%E2%80%93Ottmann_algorithm"&gt;Bentley-Ottmann algorithm&lt;/a&gt;),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;then partition these into y-monotone shapes,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;and finally tessellate these y-monotone shapes into triangles.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to come back to this in greater details in another post, but I'll just mention here that lyon's fill tessellator is a bit different from the typical implementation of monotone tessellation in the way it represents paths, and runs the steps above in single pass instead of three. Diverging from the traditional implementations seems to pay off since some &lt;a href="https://github.com/nical/lyon/blob/53b6eb48f6c01e1ff8cf6c0ce4010c9019d63e39/bench/tess/src/main.rs#L154"&gt;early measurements&lt;/a&gt; show lyon to be a bit more than twice as fast as &lt;a href="https://github.com/memononen/libtess2"&gt;libtess2&lt;/a&gt;. Take this with a grain of salt, I do need to measure a much wider range of test cases before I can boast about anything, but it's encouraging and there are still a lot of low hanging fruits on the performance side of things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Let's look at some code&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to show off some of what lyon can do for you is to look at some code snippets:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;extern&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;crate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;lyon&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;use&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;lyon&lt;/span&gt;::&lt;span class="n"&gt;math&lt;/span&gt;::&lt;span class="n"&gt;point&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;use&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;lyon&lt;/span&gt;::&lt;span class="n"&gt;path&lt;/span&gt;::&lt;span class="n"&gt;default&lt;/span&gt;::&lt;span class="n"&gt;Path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;use&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;lyon&lt;/span&gt;::&lt;span class="n"&gt;path&lt;/span&gt;::&lt;span class="n"&gt;builder&lt;/span&gt;::&lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;use&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;lyon&lt;/span&gt;::&lt;span class="n"&gt;tessellation&lt;/span&gt;::&lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;fn&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;main&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Build a Path.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;mut&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;builder&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Path&lt;/span&gt;::&lt;span class="n"&gt;builder&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;builder&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;move_to&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;point&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;builder&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;line_to&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;point&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;1.0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;builder&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;quadratic_bezier_to&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;point&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;2.0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;point&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;2.0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;1.0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;builder&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;cubic_bezier_to&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;point&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;1.0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;1.0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;point&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;1.0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;point&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;builder&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;close&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;builder&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;build&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Let&amp;#39;s use our own custom vertex type instead of the default one.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cp"&gt;#[derive(Copy, Clone, Debug)]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;struct&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;MyVertex&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;position&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;f32&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;normal&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;f32&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Will contain the result of the tessellation.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;mut&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;geometry&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;VertexBuffers&lt;/span&gt;::&lt;span class="n"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;mut&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;tessellator&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;FillTessellator&lt;/span&gt;::&lt;span class="n"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="w"&gt;                        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;normal&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span class="nc"&gt;vertex&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;normal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;to_array&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(),&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;                    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;                &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;            &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;unwrap&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// The tessellated geometry is ready to be uploaded to the GPU.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;println&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot; -- {} vertices {} indices&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;geometry&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;vertices&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;len&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(),&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;geometry&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;indices&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;len&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Et voilà! With a fairly small amount of code you can create a path and generate the vertex/index buffers that you will be able to easily render on the GPU with glium, gfx-rs, vulkano, OpenGL, or what have you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From there to pixels on your screen, it can be very simple or very complicated, that's really up to your rendering engine. You can have a look at &lt;a href="https://github.com/nical/lyon/tree/master/examples"&gt;the examples&lt;/a&gt; in the repository to get an idea. Lyon doesn't provide a renderering engine (yet), although it is something that I want to explore eventually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What else is there in lyon?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lyon's fill tessellator is by far where most of the work went so far. But there are a bunch of other goodies too. There is a stroke tessellator that supports most SVG stroke properties (line caps, joins, etc.), and some specialized fill and stroke tessellators for common/simpler shapes (circles, rounded rectangles, convex polygons, polylines etc.).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lyon is split into a few crates, in a way that is transparent for people who use the main crate, but helps with taming compile times and makes it possible for people to hand-pick certain features with minimal dependencies if they wish to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;lyon::geom&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://crates.io/crates/lyon_geom"&gt;&lt;img alt="crate" src="https://meritbadge.herokuapp.com/lyon_geom"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href="https://docs.rs/lyon_geom"&gt;&lt;img alt="doc" src="https://docs.rs/lyon_geom/badge.svg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lyon's &lt;a href="https://docs.rs/lyon_geom"&gt;geom&lt;/a&gt; module implements a lot of fun math for curve and line segments in 2D (splitting, flattening, intersecting, measuring, etc.) on top of euclid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;curve&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;QuadraticBezierSegment&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;mut&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;builder&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Path&lt;/span&gt;::&lt;span class="n"&gt;builder&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;().&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;with_svg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;().&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;flattened&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.01&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// While the builder adapters APIs provide &amp;quot;push&amp;quot;-style conversions&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// lyon::path::iterator module.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// This path stores some curves, and the events are flattened on the&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// fly by the iterator.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;event&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;path2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;path_iter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;().&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;flattened&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.01&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// ...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Place some dots at a regular interval along a path.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;mut&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;pattern&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;RegularPattern&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;callback&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;position&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span class="nc"&gt;Point&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;_tangent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;_distance&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;dots&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;push&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;position&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;interval&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span class="mf"&gt;3.0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Place dots 3.0 appart from one another.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;start_offset&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;path_iter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;().&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;flattened&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.01&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;walk&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;start_offset&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;mut&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;pattern&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I would like to evolve this crate into a sort of swiss-army-knife of path manipulations, similar to the features &lt;a href="https://github.com/paperjs/paper.js/"&gt;paperjs&lt;/a&gt; offers, for example applying boolean operations to paths, computing convex hulls, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like before, if you only want to play with paths without tessellating themyou can do &lt;code&gt;extern crate lyon_path;&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code&gt;use lyon::path;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;lyon::svg&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://crates.io/crates/lyon_svg"&gt;&lt;img alt="crate" src="https://meritbadge.herokuapp.com/lyon_svg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href="https://docs.rs/lyon_svg"&gt;&lt;img alt="doc" src="https://docs.rs/lyon_svg/badge.svg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This module reexports the (very good) &lt;a href="https://docs.rs/svgparser"&gt;svgparser crate&lt;/a&gt; and uses it to provide a simple to build a path from an SVG path syntax:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;builder&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Path&lt;/span&gt;::&lt;span class="n"&gt;builder&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;().&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;with_svg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kd"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;svg&lt;/span&gt;::&lt;span class="n"&gt;path_utils&lt;/span&gt;::&lt;span class="n"&gt;build_path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;svg_builder&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;M 0 0 L 10 0 L 10 10 L 0 10 z&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h3&gt;lyon_tess2&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://crates.io/crates/lyon_extra"&gt;&lt;img alt="crate" src="https://meritbadge.herokuapp.com/lyon_tess2"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href="https://docs.rs/lyon_extra"&gt;&lt;img alt="doc" src="https://docs.rs/lyon_tess2/badge.svg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; -&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lyon_tess2 crate is a very recent addition. It provides an alternative fill tessellator that wraps the &lt;a href="https://github.com/memononen/libtess2"&gt;libtess2&lt;/a&gt; C library. I use it mostly to have something to compare lyon against, but as the two tessellators don't have the exact same feature set it can be useful to others as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The command-line app&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The repository contains command-line application that you can use to tessellate SVG paths in your favorite terminal, render paths, flattend paths, fuzz the tessellators, find bugs, generate reduced test-cases, and maybe soon make coffee. The app could be used, for example as a tool in an art building pipeline for a game engine. It's definitely great for debugging lyon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;lyon/cli/ $ cargo run --  show -i ../assets/logo.path --fill --stroke --tolerance &lt;span class="m"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;.01
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="screenshot" src="https://nical.github.io/images/lyon-cli-screenshot.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;lyon/cli/ $ cargo run --  tessellate &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;M 0 0 L 1 0 L 1 1 L 0 1 Z&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; --fill
vertices: &lt;span class="o"&gt;[(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="m"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="m"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="m"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="m"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;)]&lt;/span&gt;
indices: &lt;span class="o"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="m"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="m"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="m"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="m"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="m"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;What's next?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many things that I'd like to see happening in the project, and it will certainly take a long time for most of them to concretise as time is a scarse resource.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Polish the fill tessellator&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fill tessellator has grown into something that I am quite happy about. It is not perfect, I definitely want to keep improving its robustness and finish implementing for the non-zero &lt;a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/painting.html#FillRuleProperty"&gt;fill rule&lt;/a&gt;, but it's already robust enough for many use cases. For example &lt;a href="http://ggez.rs"&gt;ggez&lt;/a&gt;, the rust crate to make good games easily, uses it to render polygons, and I know that a few other projects use it to make games and even to render openstreetmaps data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;A new tessellator&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to start working on a new fill tessellator optimized for curves and able to produce a resolution-independent tessellation, probably using trapezoidal partioning like &lt;a href="https://github.com/pcwalton/pathfinder"&gt;pathfinder&lt;/a&gt;. The new tessellator will work best with curves but will not be as good for polygons as a monotone tessellator, so the current tessellator is definitely here to stay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;A high level renderer on top of lyon&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was my initial goal when the project started forever ago. As it turns out tessellation was a fascinatingly and hard topic and I decided to focus on it for a while. It would be great to play with a 2D renderer for interactive content (like games and &lt;a href="https://beesandbombs.tumblr.com/"&gt;creative coding&lt;/a&gt;) and see what a 2D API designed for your GPU would look like (as opposed to GPU backends for APIs that were designed for CPUs a decade or two ago for static content, which is the state of most 2D APIs these days).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Documentation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a big documentation push a year ago and it was worth it. Let's do this again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Maybe the next feature is going to be your idea&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or even your next pull request, Who knows?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Big thanks to all contributors&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now is a good time to underline that I didn't do all of this work alone. I want to thank again all the &lt;a href="https://github.com/nical/lyon/wiki/Contributors#contributors"&gt;awesome individuals&lt;/a&gt; who submitted contributions, big and small, to the project. This project is too large for a single person's spare time, and seeing people come and give a hand is the most rewarding and motivating thing. Also thanks a lot to everyone who is using lyon and reporting bugs!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Want to join the fun? Check out the &lt;a href="https://github.com/nical/lyon/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md"&gt;contribution guidelines&lt;/a&gt;, get started on the &lt;a href="https://github.com/nical/lyon/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22"&gt;easier issues&lt;/a&gt;, and don't hesitate to ask any question on &lt;a href="https://gitter.im/lyon-rs/Lobby"&gt;gitter&lt;/a&gt; or irc in #rust-gamedev.
I want this project to be as fun and welcoming as possible and I would love it to be more of a team effort than a one man show. If you are running into issues contribting, &lt;a href="https://github.com/nical/lyon/issues/32"&gt;let me know&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
